# K-means Clustering

## Overview

This repository features a Python implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm, a widely used technique for partitioning datasets into clusters. The code demonstrates how to apply K-means clustering to a customer segmentation dataset.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the `Cust_Segmentation.csv` dataset, which includes attributes of various customers:

- `Customer Id`: Unique identifier for each customer
- `Age`: Age of the customer
- `Edu`: Education level of the customer
- `Years Employed`: Number of years the customer has been employed
- `Income`: Annual income of the customer
- `Card Debt`: Credit card debt of the customer
- `Other Debt`: Other forms of debt the customer has
- `Defaulted`: Whether the customer has defaulted on their payments (binary indicator)
- `Address`: Address code for the customer
- `DebtIncomeRatio`: Ratio of debt to income

## Files

- `Code.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the implementation of K-means clustering and dataset analysis
- `Cust_Segmentation.csv`: CSV file containing customer data for clustering

## Usage

The Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step guide to implementing K-means clustering, including:

- Data preprocessing
- Feature selection and normalization
- Applying the K-means algorithm
- Evaluating the clustering outcomes

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. You can open issues or submit pull requests for any improvements or bug fixes.

## Acknowledgements

- The dataset used is publicly available from various data repositories.
- The K-means clustering algorithm is a standard technique in machine learning.
